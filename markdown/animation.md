## Pre-Production 

### Storyboarding
We want to create a **character-driven** story. 

Consider the character's:
- mindset 
	- what does this character believe in?
	- what are their motivations?
- wants + needs
	- what is their ultimate goal?
	- what do they need to accomplish to reach those goals?
- obstacles 
	- what is preventing them from making it to their goal?
- character arc
	- how do the actions they face cause their character to change?
	- what have they learned? 

Storyboarding = Staging (camera) + Acting

##### Staging
**There are different sizes and angles when it comes to staging, which depict different moods and emotions.** 

**Establishing Shot** (setting the scene):

#### Pixar Rules of Storytelling 

1. You gotta keep in mind what's interesting to you as an audience, not what's fun to do as a writer.
2. What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal?
3. Coincidences to get characters into trouble are great; coincidences to get them out of it are cheating.

#### Tips

- standard storyboard resolution: 1920x1080 px
	- thing rectangular, use index cards 
- focus on the main action of the scene 
	- includes change of expression and big movements 
- B&W, no color 
- animatics = timed storyboards, usually includes sound/dialogue, helps us determine the timing for each scene of the final film 

#### Pitching

- telling your story to your audience 
- a performance in itself 

### Visual Development & Style

Color & lighting matter, think Carmen Sandiego/Incredibles:
![[Pasted image 20240416170257.png|300]]![[Pasted image 20240416175444.png|300]]

You want to make some moodboards in order to determine what kind of visual style you want. 

#### Character Design 
Make them have a strong silhouette that is easily recognizable. 
![[Pasted image 20240416180523.png|400]]![[Pasted image 20240416180559.png|500]]

Can also create expression sheets so that we can understand the character's emotions and poses:

Create character model sheets based on T-posing and then use it to actually create the character:

## Modeling

A basic polygon **mesh** consists of vertex positions and topology (which are connections defining edges and faces).

Meshes are the most common representation of 3D geometry used in animation. Other 3D representations do exist (NURBS, point clouds, etc).

Animators prefer **quad meshes** (4 sided faces). This is because we get better edge flow and smoothing compared to triangle meshes. 

We need to avoid **floating vertices** and **N-gons**. 
- Floating vertices are vertices without a purpose. All vertices should be connected to at least 3 edges. They are artifacts that arise when you, say, delete an edge of a mesh but donâ€™t also delete the vertices that create it. These can lead to unwanted deformations. To avoid this, when deleting an edge, you should press CTRL + DELETE (available in Modeling Cheat Sheet). 
- N-Gons are polygons that have more than four sides. All faces should be quads bc of edgeflow.

#### Edge Flow

Edge flow describes how a model's edges move across the 3D surface. It's important not only for the shape, but also how the model is deformed. Every vertex must connect with one another. Edge flow should form a continuous path across the model and should be relatively organized. 
#### Transforms

Every 3D object in Maya has a transform attribute. This describes the translation, rotation, and scale of the entire object and its children. 

Moving individual mesh components (vertices, edges, faces) doesn't affect the transform. Moving in object mode changes the transform. 

When you group objects, you are actually creating an empty transform and assigning all of the selected objects as children of that transform.
