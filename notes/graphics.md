üìì **Drafts must be written following these rules:**
- written in plain English, detailed, no bullet points 
- as much as possible, use code and figures to show the point not tell
- break down into lots of subtopics if needed, don‚Äôt be afraid of too much nesting 
- definitions/vocab words should be callouts, this emphasizes what needs to be learnt and can become a flashcard later 
- todos will be marked in **red**
