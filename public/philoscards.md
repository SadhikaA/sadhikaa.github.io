mind-body problem/dualism
how do our mental states and thinking create/cause/relate to our physical states

qualia
the first person, subjective experience vs measurable, third person objective experience (which is measurable, physical phenomena)

consciousness creates qualia
an organism can only have conscious mental states iff there is something that it is like to *be* that organism 

explanatory gap 
how do explain the physical objective experience given the subjective experience and can we recreate the objective experience given the subjective one
