#### Retirement Accounts 

IRA 
individual retirement account (can invest in stocks/bonds) but can also lose money if stock underperforms, in 2024 can invest a max of **7k annually**.

401(k) 
Employer sponsored retirement account, can deposit portion of paycheck before taxes into investment account. Can access funds at any time, but pay 10% penalty for withdrawal before age 59.5. Contribute upto **23k annually**.

RMD 
Required minimum distributions, start at age 73, and are required withdrawals you have to make and pay ordinary income tax rates, can put you in a higher tax bracket.

Traditional IRA 
Contribute pre-tax dollars, lowering your taxable income, government doesn't tax the deposits but will tax the distributions you receive in your retirement, at bottom-up marginal tax rate

Roth IRA
Uses the money government has already taxed, so distributions during retirement are tax-free. But money is taxed at highest rate. Best if single w/ income less than 161k, after that minimal contributions are allowed.

Roth vs Traditional 
Trad is better to retire in a state with low income tax, don't pay taxes in a high marginal tax rate right now. Roth is better when retiring a state with high income tax, have tax deductions now and don't later.

Strat
Invest your 401(k) tax savings/deductions each year in a Roth IRA (contributing let's you save on taxes in the current year instead of spending the tax savings - invest that amount into a Roth IRA which gives you tax savings now and tax free growth in the future)
