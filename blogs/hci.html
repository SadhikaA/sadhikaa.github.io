                        the implications of such a vision?</li>
                    <blockquote>Weiser describes the fact that we shouldn't be subject to a single area - that our ideas
                        should move along with us in the form of pads and tabs. However, since he also wants it to blend
                        into the environment, Weiser proposes computers everywhere so that they can interact with you
                        without you noticing that there are computers.</blockquote>

                    <li><mark>groupware</mark> is the new name for social computing that developed</li>
                    <li>8 challenges:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><mark>disparity in work and benefit</mark> - benefits are different across all group
                            members, some people adjust more than others, ex: people not maintaining their own personal
                            calendars defeats the purpose of automatic scheduler</li>
                        <li><mark>critical mass and prisoner's dilemma problems</mark> - only useful to a high
                            percentage of users, but we want a "critical mass" to use it, esp if its a communication
                            tool > reduce the work required of all users</li>
                        <li><mark>disruption of social processes</mark> - computer exists in a world of explicit,
                            concrete information but we have social, motivational, political factors that are not stable
                            or explicit</li>
                        <li><mark>exception handling</mark> - software should not just support standard procedures,
                            should also have a wide range of error handling, exception handling, and improvisation to
                            match human activity</li>
                        <li><mark>unobtrusive accessibility</mark> - increase in size can lead to a decrease in
                            efficiency, accessibility should be effective</li>
                        <li><mark>difficulty of evaluation</mark> - almost insurmountable obstacles to meaningful,
                            generalizable, analysis and evaluation of groupware prevent us from learning from experience
                            (varying backgrounds, individual vs group)</li>
                        <li><mark>failure of intuition</mark> - intuitions in product development environments are
                            especially poor for multiuser applications, resulting in bad management decisions and an
                            error-prone design process</li>
                        <li><mark>adoption process</mark> - groupware requires more careful implementation
                            (introduction) in the workplace than product developers have confronted, identify problems
                            and use cases</li>

                        info needed for the task, often must turn to web, barriers from conceptual</li>
                    <li>what is the actual goal of the programming intervention? are some programming languages better

                    <li>Are you trying to lower the threshold or raise the ceiling?</li>
                    <li>How can we lower thresholds: reduce expressiveness in exchange of a smaller gulf of execution
                        and evaluation, ex: regex is easier than others, but also less expressive; no code tools, data
                        science jupyter notebooks, etc</li>

                        language, and position the software to expose that level of expressivity, ex: Engelbart also had
                        chorded keyset in original demo for musical expressiveness, attach computational functions to

                        healthcare, education, disaster management, government</li>
                    <li>"technology, no matter how well designed, is only a magnifier of human intent and capacity. it
                        is not a substitute"</li>
                    <li>IC4TD focus is on Asia and Africa</li>
                    <li><mark>rethinking technology in the context of local communities</mark>: are graphical user
                        interfaces the norm for other places and regions, image-based/speech-based vs text-based</li>
                    <li>what has worked: mobile Q&A for farmers, village based stations for local cellular network,
                        digitizing paper forms</li>
                    <li><mark>supporting development efforts</mark>: rather than creating something brand-new, how can
                        we add to what exists</li>
                    <li>ex: crowdsourcing platform in Kenya to aid crisis mapping, medication adherence through phone
                        calls</li>
                    <li>what role does social media play in revolutions - is it an enabler or simply present?</li>
                    <li><mark>technology as new versions of old problems</mark>: postcolonial computing (assumptions
                        about what other people can understand, not navigating past our default cultural frame), privacy
                        with shared devices</li>
                    <li>ideas: invest in people, not technology, </li>

                    <li>the mobile phone is the best way to reach a global development focus, however, much of the
                        population is illiterate and/or novice at using their phone</li>
                    <li>input methods: typing, structured speech, free-form speech</li>
                    <li>output methods: text, audio, graphical UI</li>
                    <li>conducted studies in India, Philippines, and South Africa on two tasks: completing a mobile bank
                        transaction with access to text, voice, and graphics vs entering health data with minimal errors
                        using text vs live operator</li>
                    <li>voice recordings of help information is very helpful to users, icon-based interfaces also work
                        better</li>
                    <li>however, ethnography and region based differences also need to be accounted for, also prior
                        experience using mobile phones</li>
                    <li><mark>usability barriers</mark>: hierarchal navigation, discoverability in deep menu systems,
                        scroll bars are initially not understood, unlabeled keys, nonnumeric inputs, language
                        difficulties</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Vannevar Bush's idea of the memex - "wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made
                        with a mesh of associative trails running through them"</li>
                    <li>Memex inspires Sutherland and his GUI which inspires Doug Engelbart's mouse and demo which
                        inspires Alan Kay - "the best way to predict the future is to invent it"</li>
                    <li>Xerox Star draws from Engelbart and Kay's ideas (WYSIWYG, mouse and keys, direct manipulation,
                        desktop metaphor, bitmapped display) which inspires Lisa which allows Mac to be created</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>"The human mind does not work in that way. It operates by association. With one item in its
                        grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in
                        accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain. It has other
                        characteristics, of course; trails that are not frequently followed are prone to fade, items are
                        not fully permanent, memory is transitory. Yet this speed of action, the intricacy of trails,
                        the detail of mental pictures, is awe-inspiring beyond all else in nature. Man cannot hope fully
                        to duplicate this mental process artificially, but he certainly ought to be able to learn from
                        it."</li>
