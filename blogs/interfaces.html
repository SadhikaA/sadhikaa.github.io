                <!-- <p>Think about the last time you used a physical calculator, or even better, a physical graphing calculator. For me, being able to solve a problem, clanking the keys on my TI-84 and seeing equations being plot before my eyes, devising shortcuts, coming up with customizations, and tinkering with my calculator, I found that I didn't get the same feeling when I used any online calculator. It was able to provide something that felt real, felt like I had gotten the solution, even though both were providing the same answer.</p> -->

        <div class="rest-of-text add-inter">
            <!--TODO: insert image of TI 84 -->
            <!-- <p>What does my TI-84 have to do with AI? Essentially, both ChatGPT and TI-84 are tools that furthered my learning, helped answer questions, and gived me solutions to what I'm asking. But one feels more... fun. The TI-84 helped me land somewhere between human computation and machine intelligence, a copilot, one that I could bring along with me to solve smaller parts of larger problems. 
            </p> -->
            <!--TODO: insert image of text box -->
            <!-- <p>ChatGPT works in the same way, but its inputs are severely limited. With one textbox, I'm forced to determine the context, prompt, and variables that I want to address without any preset values or settings that can finetune what I'm looking for.</p> -->
            <h3 id="chat" style="color: #3B37FC;">ChatGPT</h3>
            <!-- <p>A chat interface is intuitive and simple to use as a first contact method of getting questions answered and easily going back and forth, "talking" to GPT. Some common use cases of ChatGPT can be broken up into: code-related question, writing-related question, and Google 2.0.</p> -->
            <!--TODO: insert chart here with the code, writing, google 2.0 thing and the funnels -->
            <!--TODO: the thing about funnels in words-->
            <!-- <p>The inputs and outputs are mostly constrained to text, code, and lists. There are no links or images and a lot of content repeats when similar questions are asked. When we want to add more context and built it into our own programs, we create funnels where the newest ___.ai will automatically combine something you've always done with... AI. How can we improve the way that we interact with AI and create interfaces that are more natural to work with, where we feel more like we're working together with AI? In this post, I want to discuss 3 ways we can make our AI interfaces more useful.</p> -->
            <h3 id="state" style="color: #3B37FC;">Context-Aware and Persistance</h3>
            <!-- <p>Let's take a look at four different use cases of AI. First, we have <mark>ChatGPT</mark>, which opens with an empty textbox, with no context of what we're currently working on or curious about.</p> -->
            <!-- <p>Second, we have <mark>Khanmigo</mark>, an AI tutor for students to learn on Khan Academy. Here our interface hasn't changed much, but we're provided with the context of the problem we're working on. Ideally, we would not need to give much additional information since Khanmigo is aware of which question we're on and what topic we're learning.</p> -->
            <!--TODO: image for, Khanmigo image provided by NYT -->
