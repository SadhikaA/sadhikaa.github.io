    <p class="subtitle">Reflections on ten years of dancing, performing, and mastery</p>
    <div class="rest-of-text add-inter">
      <p>Between 2010-2021, I practiced Bharatanatyam, the oldest Indian classical dance. A challenging, yet intricate art, It brings me closer to my heritage while bonding and learning with my dance group. The word "Bharatanatyam" comes from three elements: "Bhava" (expression), "Raga" (melody), and "Tala" (rhythm). Combining these elements is what allows the art form to convey stories, emotions, and spiritual themes.</p>
      <p>I began dancing at the age of six with a friend of my mom teaching me. The following year I transferred to the
        Nrithyollasa Dance Academy to pursue a more formal dance education.</p>
      <p>The Nrithyollasa Dance Academy was founded in 1989. The academy provides intense training that enables students to gain mastery over this ancient dance form. I began my first years learning the Adavas, which involved basic repetitive movements and no additional music. These were the building blocks used in longer pieces later, which made them essential to master. After spending three years perfecting Adavas, my group and I made the transition to much longer, completely choreographed pieces. These pieces were set to beautiful Carnatic music, which described ancient mythical stories. While dancing, the goal was to represent the different characters, emotions, and stories using facial expressions, hand gestures, footwork, and complex body movement. Over the years I learnt multiple different components of a full Bharatanatyam performance: Alarippu (warm-up), Jatiswaram (pure dance sequence), and Tillana (fast-paced rhythmic dance).</p>
      <p>I performed with my dance group in various fundraisers and Indian cultural events. These performances required intense preparation and memorization. Throughout the years, Bharatanatyam taught me discipline and patience, while making me more connected to my culture.</p>
