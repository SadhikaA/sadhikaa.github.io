          <p>In the fall, I took a decal (class led by Berkeley students) on 3D modeling and animation. Over the course of the semester, we covered all parts of the animation pipeline from pre-production, modeling, rigging, shading, lighting, animation, and post-production. I've wanted to learn about how Pixar movies were really made for a long time but this class truly gave me the greatest insights into the process and made me garner a new respect for all of the work that went into making these animated movies. My final project for the class culminated in making an animated short, which was worked on parallel with the content of the course.</p>
          <h4>Pre-Production</h4>
          <div className={styles.imageContainer}>
            <Image src={character} alt="character" width={350} className={styles.mobileImage}/>
          </div>
          <h4>Modeling</h4>
          <p>I built...</p>
          <h4>Rigging</h4>
          <h4>Shading</h4>
          <h4>Animation</h4>
          <h4>Rendering</h4>
          <h4>Post-Production</h4>
          <p>Post-production mostly involved adding music and final edits.</p>
          <p>Between this project and my drone project, the end of the semester was a wild ride, but I definitely learned a lot and got two great learning experiences out of it, albeit very different from each other (hardware and animation).</p>
